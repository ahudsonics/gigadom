# Gigadom - React Job Management System Todo App

Gigadom is a React-based Job Management System Todo app created using the MERN stack. It provides features such as user login, saving tasks to the database, allowing users to access only their todos, and full CRUD operations for a comprehensive user experience.

## Application Technical Requirements/Deliverables:

Gigadom is a versatile tracker app that combines elements of both a budget calculator and a todo list into a unified functional application.

1. **Interactive Front-end**:
   The application boasts a well-styled, interactive front-end that seamlessly communicates with the Express backend via AJAX. The complete code for both ends is included.

2. **Token-based Authentication**:
   Gigadom implements token-based authentication, allowing users to sign up, log in, and log out with ease. The entire authentication code is provided for reference.

3. **Authorization**:
   The application enforces proper authorization by restricting functionality to authenticated users.

4. **Dynamic Navigation**:
   Navigation within Gigadom is responsive and adjusts based on the login status of the user, ensuring a seamless user experience.

5. **Data Entities**:
   Gigadom includes a minimum of one user data entity used for authentication. Additional data entities can be added and related if required.

6. **Comprehensive Feature-set**:
   The app encompasses a comprehensive feature-set with full CRUD operations distributed across all data entities.

## How It Works:

Once a user is logged into their account, they can create todo list type cards and input various details like job name, type, description, project duration, company or client details, hours spent versus expected, budget spent versus expected, paid per hour (final) versus expected, and a section for day-to-day notes.
